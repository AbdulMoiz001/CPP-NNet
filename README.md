# CPP Neural Network Project

This project implements a neural network in C++ to perform the XOR operation. The neural network utilizes custom-made Dynamic Safe Array data structures to optimize memory usage.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a neural network in C++ for learning the XOR operation. The neural network architecture includes both forward propagation and backward propagation algorithms.

## Features

- Neural network implemented in C++
- Utilizes custom-made Dynamic Safe Array data structures
- Implements both forward propagation and backward propagation algorithms
- Learns and performs the basic XOR operation
